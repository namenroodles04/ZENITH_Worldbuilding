## VULTURE ZENITH VIRUS STUDY (TALON SECTOR) ##
*The following entries span over a month following the evolution of one android that, unfortunately, fell victim to the ZENITH Virus. With the android’s permission prior to their infection (signed and/or verbal consent is provided by any android we permit within Vulture), the Talon Sector conducted research on the virus’ evolution.*

*Talon clearance and above is required for accessing the following entries. Any member not permitted to view the following files will face punishment directly from the Head sector if they are caught doing so.*

Virus Stage: 3 

Last night, we recorded that, despite our best efforts, Genevive succumbed to the ZENITH Virus. She began displaying symptoms almost immediately, namely first with “devil tears” (as many refer to it). We immediately locked her in a safe room to prevent any injuries or casualties. No one is permitted to enter the safehouse, despite how much she may beg. It is important to note that any Genevive we knew previously no longer exists, due to notable corruption in her processor. No matter how much she screams, it is only a trick. Do not give in.

Virus Stage: 4 

A guard recorded disturbing noises coming from within the saferoom housing Genevive. Upon further inspection, it seemed that she had begun to disassemble herself and attempted to tear down the inside of the room to “repair” herself. A lack of materials within the room has proved her to be largely unsuccessful in doing so. What she was most capable of warping was a sheet of metal (peeled off the wall) into a spear, which she grafted onto her left arm. The devil tears have slowed significantly, almost drying around her eyes and forcing them open. There is still some flow though. Otherwise, most of her behavior remains the same—she still screams to let her go, but now stabs at the walls in an attempt to carve her way out. Extra guard rotations have been instructed to keep a close eye on her, and alert Talon Head immediately if she began to pose a lethal threat to the other Vulture members. 

 

**[July 17th, 2306]**

Virus Stage: 5 

Genevive has become completely unresponsive. Not dead, per se, but not moving at the very least. We believe this might have to do with the fact that Genevive was unable to contact any other androids when she entered the “Hive” stage of the virus. This is a rather recent phenomenon, detailed earlier in June. According to reports from the Wing Sector, Hives are large amalgamations of other androids and humans. It is theorized that, because androids lose almost all of their black blood (or devil tears) they resort to these Hives to not only grow in strength, but to replace the black blood with that of human blood. It is unclear whether this habit is reflected in other androids prior to them becoming Hives—however, our research on Genevive did uncover an interesting tendency for androids when they are prevented from becoming a Hive: Genevive has embedded herself into the wall of the saferoom. Completely immobile, but still alive. The flow of devil tears has stopped completely, jamming her eye sockets into a permanently open state. The only sign of outward life she constantly conveys is her voice; she repeatedly, and without any breaks, repeats the phrase “need blood”—despite the fact that significant damage had been done to her lower jaw. 

The sketches below were provided by one of the guards stationed outside at the time of the incident.

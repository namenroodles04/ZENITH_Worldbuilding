I’m not sure what I expected, to be honest. The rest of the city was in ruins, so it only made sense that the bridge had long been destroyed—a pathetic pile of rubble submerged fully by the wide, violent river below. The crashing water against the debris snickered and hissed, taunted me with an escape that I could never have. Fine. 

“We’ll just have to find a way around,” I conceded before turning back on my heels and walking toward where we first came, the wind blowing off the river and whipping my hair around my face. 

Simon grabbed my mechanical wrist before I could get too far, “I’m not sure there’s another way, Charlie. We checked four other roads; the androids had either already destroyed them or were patrolling around them.” 

“Well, there has to be something! We can’t just be trapped here, Simon. There has to be a way out!” 

“And if there isn’t?” Simon snapped back. 

“Are you giving up?” I pulled my arm out of his grip. He looked tired. 

“No, I’m just saying... We’ve been searching for a way out of the city for a while now. I was just thinking, if there was a way out, wouldn’t we have found it already?” He paused briefly, looking as though he hated what he was about to say, “if there was help coming, wouldn’t they already be here?” 

I stared at him silently. 

“I mean seriously, it's not like we can go to NAIL. Unless you are okay with them taking off your limbs,” Simon gestured to the metallic lower half of my body. “And we haven’t even been able to find any Vultures. It's like they’re hiding from us on purpose.” 

“...We have to keep looking.” I continued back into the heart of the city, into the maw of a beast intent on consuming everything in it. Simon, reluctantly, followed close behind me. 

A few hours had passed before we had set up camp in some derelict apartment building, a few blocks away from Entech HQ—the bastards that caused this mess in the first place. Their androids went haywire, turning against everyone out of nowhere. Most people have gone into hiding now, since those found are killed almost immediately by the androids. If you’re lucky, they’ll do it quick. But based on what I’ve seen, they’re still working on their aim. Or they’re purposefully torturing humans when they’re caught. I’m not sure which is worse. 

 Simon looked more worn down now than he did before, his face pale and dark eyes slightly sunken. It had suddenly occurred to me that we hadn’t eaten in a few days, and that food was something you needed to fuel these kinds of expeditions. I suppose I hadn’t felt it as much due to the lower half of my body being made up of Entech prosthetics (the irony is not lost on me), and his still entirely flesh. The fatigue isn’t something I missed with my old legs. 

“I’m fine.” Simon blurted out as if I were reading his mind. 

“Here,” I reached into the small bag I had packed the week prior to us venturing out. “It’s all I have left though, after this we need to find more food.” 

Simon wordlessly took the portion of stale bread from my hand and chewed. I shifted my gaze from his glassy eyes and out towards the streets below. The Entech building shone like a beacon amongst the destruction of the city around it. Even from here, I could see the groups of androids patrolling around the area. It had to be some sick joke, a cruel twist of irony. It was something I saw in all those science fiction movies, not in real life. My eyes traced the cracked pavement of the road, littered with the remnants of human life—snuffed out and erased. 

“The only direction we haven’t checked is past Entech,” I nodded toward the broken window, a light breeze whistling past my ears. 

“Yeah, for good reason, Charlie. You know that’s where the androids always are. It’s a death wish even trying to get to the West side. They blocked all the roads. It’s that or they destroyed everything around it to make it impossible to pass.” 

“What other choice do we have? You said it yourself; no one is coming. No one wants to help.” 

Simon sighed. “I guess. Let’s at least wait until morning.” 

“Of course,” I turned to face Simon and squeezed his hand with mine. “We’ll make it out of here, together.” 

“Yeah,” a small grin crept across his weary face. “Good night, Charlie.” 

I smiled, “night.” 

*** 

The next morning brought with it a startling heat. The breeze from the night prior was but a distant memory as I dabbed the sweat off my forehead. I turned over from my makeshift cot and looked to Simon, who had already gotten up and had been fiddling with a radio.  

“Maybe one of these days, you’ll actually find something,” I snickered. 

Simon rolled his eyes, “y’know, for someone made of mostly robot parts, you do sleep for a long time.” 

“I need sleep just as much as you do!” I scoffed, “besides, it’s not like I chose to be all metal.” 

“I know, I know,” Simon put down the buzzing radio and gestured sympathetically with his hands, “I was kidding. Sorry.” 

“It’s alright,” I grinned, and grabbed his shoulder with my cybernetic hand. “You might need some too if you keep teasing me about it, though!” 

Simon laughed, “heard, loud and clear.” 

We turned to pack our things and headed towards the West side of the city. Simon already clearly objected, saying it was a suicide mission—but we both agreed we didn’t have much of a choice left anyways. 

The air was even hotter on the ground than it was camped out in the building. It was stagnant—a suffocating heat that clung to my skin and pushed the air out of my lungs. I could tell that Simon was feeling it, too. The tired expression that seemed to be permanently frozen onto his face was now accompanied by one of desperation. I knew that this was our last shot, and it looked like he knew it too. 

It wasn’t long before we neared the towering building. Despite its pristine condition, Entech was surrounded by rubble and what looked to be improvised patrol stations built by androids. I held my breath as Simon and I stepped closer to the torn-up courtyard. I took note of three, maybe four groups of androids each patrolling different areas in front of the main entrance. There’s probably even more on the other side. Their footsteps fell heavy, the sound of metal grating against concrete and stone. If I didn’t know any better, I would’ve guessed that their steps are what caused the ground beneath them to splinter and crack—scratch that, it probably was them. As they marched on, their heads rotated slowly back and forth, scanning for any signs of human life. A viscous black liquid seeped from their eyes and stained the fake skin of their faces. Despite that, it didn’t seem to hinder their sight in any way. At least, I knew we had to be careful to stay hidden. One wrong move and Simon and I would be ripped apart. 

I looked past the androids for some path of escape—some alternate route that would take us safely past what is likely the most dangerous part of the entire city. Maybe the line of buildings could cover us long enough to make a break for one of the blockades? My eyes darted to the other side of the building. Or maybe we could climb up the scaffolding on the opposite side, but there could be more androids up there too... 

“Shit. Now what?” I hissed under my breath. Simon shook his head silently, his wide eyes tracing the movement ahead, as if to say I don’t know, this is a bad idea. 

 My attention shifted back ahead. There’s no use hanging back any longer, it looked like every possible path was just as risky as the other. I motioned forward with my hand and slowly crept toward Entech, Simon moving breathlessly behind me. We crouched low behind a splintered concrete wall, bits of metal pipe and wire jutting out in all directions—like the veins and organs of some stone giant. Every step was carefully placed to not draw any attention to us silently navigating the destruction of the Entech courtyard. The unblemished building stood there, defiantly, sneering and mocking our pathetic attempt to survive. 

Almost as soon as we began moving, the mechanical lurching of an android patrol noisily cracked to our right, just past the crumbling concrete wall we were hiding behind. I threw my hand out backwards to stop Simon, who froze and tightly shut his eyes. 

Besides the noise made by their footfalls, the android pack was completely silent. I moved my hand to cover my mouth, the pounding of the androids' steps sending vibrations through the ground and rattling inside my head. By the sound of it, it could be anywhere from six or ten of them. Their stepping in unison made it hard to tell. They continued their patrol, safely out of sight. I let a deep sigh escape my lungs and turned back to Simon. His eyes were still sealed shut. 

“Simon, it’s safe. You can open your eyes now,” I tapped him lightly on the shoulder. 

His eyes locked with mine as he let himself breathe again, “Jesus... I don’t think I’ll ever get used to those things.” 

“We need to keep moving,” I whispered. 

“Right. Let's go.” 

I began to shuffle ahead, trying my best to keep my head down. 

“Uh, Charlie?” 

“What?” 

“You can let go of me now,” my prosthetic hand was still resting on his shoulder from where I had nudged him earlier. 

“Oh right, sorry,” I chuckled nervously. “Guess I need to replace this thing soon.” 

I went to retract my arm away from him and walked forward once more. 

“Charlie, seriously. Let go.” Unbeknownst to me, my grip had tightened around his arm. He was squirming now. 

“Shit, sorry, I thought I—” I grabbed the metallic arm with my free hand and tried to pry it from him. 

“Don’t tell me it’s stuck? Is it malfunctioning or something?” Simon’s hands were wrapped around the prosthetic now, trying his best to claw it off. 

“I don’t know, this hasn’t happened before, I guess it’s possible?” I tried to stay quiet as I fought against my own body. 

“Agh!” Simon let out a gasp of pain as my grip tightened further. 

“Quiet! Be careful!” I whispered through my teeth. “Don’t make too much noise!” 

“Easy for you to say!” 

Without me realizing, I had risen to my feet. Simon was still crouched below me, my arm cemented in place on him. I raised him by his arm. 

“Charlie, please! It hurts!” He writhed in my grasp. 

“I’m sorry, I don’t know what's happening! Simon please!” 

“Agh, fuck! Charlie!” I could see his arm creaking, bending below his shoulder in a way it shouldn’t. 

Tears flowed from my eyes as panic set in. One of the android patrols would be here any second now, especially with all the noise we were making. But I couldn’t even move. I couldn’t let Simon go. 

Simon’s shoulder finally gave out with a nauseating snap. He screamed. The earth-shaking sound of android footsteps scraped against the ground once more. 

“Charlie...Charlie please....” He sobbed in between words, hanging limply from his shattered arm.  

Despite his broken state, the hand squeezed tighter, “I’m so sorry Simon, I’m so sorry...” The one hand I still had control over trembled.  

He cried out in agony, the metallic fingers now steeped in his blood. The incessant crashing of android steps drew closer. Unlike the last patrol, this group sounded bigger. Better equipped for our execution. I turned my neck painfully towards the android’s direction, fighting against Simon’s weeping. The androids had already seen us, our position exposed. They marched continuously forward, not bothering to quicken their pace to meet us sooner. Not that it mattered, since my legs refused to move no matter how much I tried. 

“Charlie... they’ll kill us... you know they’ll kill us...” The metallic hand was slick with his blood now—most of it was either there or seeped out onto the ground. 

I shook my head, “No! No, I said we would get out! I’m going to get you out!” The hand tightened. 

“Charlie... just... kill me...” Simon was deathly pale, drifting in and out of consciousness from the pain or the blood loss, perhaps both. 

The hand tightened. 

The androids were here. 

Silently, and without hesitation, one of the androids ripped Simon from me, violently pulling his body and leaving his broken arm behind. Blood and viscera dragged behind him from the now severed limb. I felt bile rise in the back of my throat, choked down through the violent sobs shaking the remains of my trapped, pitiful body. Simon screamed, kicking and thrashing as much as he could as the android dragged him away. 

Just as soon as he was ripped away from me, the android dropped him onto the ground and caved his skull in with its foot. Bone and brain matter spattered out from beneath its heel, painting the pavement a sickly, deep red. 

“No! No, no, no—Simon!” I cried out, frozen in the same position, still gripping his arm like a vice. 

The android shifted its black-hole gaze to me while the others stood by and watched. I screamed as a booming voice shattered the inside of my head: 

YOU MUST ABANDON THE SINFUL FLESH AND ATONE. 

YOU MUST PAY WITH YOUR LIFE. 

YOUR VESSEL WILL BE A TESTAMENT TO OUR GREATER STRENGTH. 

YOU MUST PAY WITH YOUR LIFE. 

OFFER YOURSELF TO US IN THE NAME OF ES8-10. 

YOU MUST PAY WITH YOUR LIFE. 

My feet moved on their own. Slowly, they trudged forward, past the wall and over the mauled body of Simon. In front of this android, its voice still ringing in my ears, I collapsed to my knees. The android reached out and planted its rubbery hand on my forehead. There was nothing, and there was everything. It slid its hand down my face, clasping it gently now with both of its hands. It felt like nothing, and it felt like everything. I could hear its voice still as it gouged out my eyes. I felt nothing and everything. Perhaps I screamed, perhaps I did not. My body was no longer my own. 

They pried Simons arm from my hand. The android lowered itself and wrapped one hand around the shoulder of my prosthetic, the other around the wrist. Its hand, still slick with my blood, pulled the mechanical arm off of my body with ease. Then it took one leg. And then the other. My limp body hung there dumbly, trapped in what seemed to be an eternity of being ripped at the seams. When it was finished, they collected my spare parts and left. They left me, blind, and deafened by the voice of that android clawing up the walls of my skull. 

I must pay with my life.

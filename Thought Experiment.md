# What if... A single tech corporation lead to the collapse of humanity as we know it? #

## The Deal

Entech Corporation spawned quite literally out of nowhere. No one except a close few know exactly how the massive tech company came to be; the unfortunate truth is that very little human innovation was involved. A mysterious figure, known at present as ES8-10, offered a deal to one unsuspecting Dr. Silas Moore. ES8-10 offered Dr. Moore extensive technological expertise, far from human comprehension, including the means of teleportation—the answer to a life-long study he had so desperately searched for. All ES8-10 required was a signature in blood. 

## Sowing

Blessed with this new knowledge, Dr. Moore conducted his own experiments with technology to incredible success. He found that not a single one of his experiments failed, including, but not limited to, teleportation, sentient AI, and telepathy. Dr. Moore, as any good scientist would, sought to commercialize his findings. Despite some push-back from the US government, they couldn’t deny that this revolutionary technology could not only change the lives of the American people, but how they organize their military as well. Ultimately, this technology hit the shelves. 

## Reaping 

The date was October 13th, 2305, when the first reported android malfunction within the US was reported. In what officials initially covered up as a freak accident, a young couple was slaughtered in their home at the hands of an android. First responders promptly dispatched the android as soon as they arrived, but both the man and woman were reported DOA. It was a gruesome display of unnecessary violence, with the man’s limbs ripped from his body and the woman’s eyes gouged. The autopsy report speculated that, while the man had certainly bled to death, the cause of death for the woman was more mysterious in nature. Doctors argued that she died to asphyxiation just under a week before the murder scene was discovered; others argue that she simply died of a traumatic brain injury, and that the accelerated rate of decomposition is another mystery of the strange case.  

Regardless of the circumstance, word got out the androids now had the potential for violence—seemingly at random. Chaos erupted throughout the entire country, demanding harsher regulations on the technology. Eventually, these protests spread all over the world, as the rate of android related deaths skyrocketed. People began to publicly dismantle and beat any android they saw. Fights erupted in the streets between androids and humans—the androids now suddenly hellbent on the complete annihilation of the human race. The world reacted too late. No number of regulations or laws could save humanity now. 

# What happens next? 

## Annihilation Protocol 

Humanity is no longer safe no matter where they run or hide. Thanks to the extensive backlog of information collected by Entech, androids operate as a sort of hivemind—constantly exchanging intel on the current whereabouts of any nearby human settlement (homes, shelters, etc. Basically, any place housing any number of humans). In the event that an android is destroyed, they activate an emergency protocol that releases all that unit’s gathered data back to the Entech hivemind. Android strike teams now constantly patrol the street in groups due to their placement within the US military. The government has collapsed, the military has been dismantled from the inside, and humanity is largely left without any direction on how to fight back. 

## Established Factions 

Ten years have passed without any yield from the now corrupted Entech Corporation. Over the years, small groups of survivors have collected, finding strength in numbers. Those smaller groups evolved into larger factions based around the one goal of survival. One of these factions, NAIL, grew to gain enough members to pursue a “cure” to whatever was corrupting androids all over the world. Or at least, a way to eliminate all of Entech—including the androids. This goal created a stark divide between humans and androids, as androids became strictly forbidden from entering a NAIL camp. Any NAIL member that spots an android is tasked to either eliminate it immediately or evacuate the area (depending on the circumstance). 

The Vultures, perhaps on the other side of the same coin, have a different take on android treatment. While they are more loosely governed and known to frequently raid human and android camps alike (“every man for themself” philosophy), Vultures do have established safe havens, or “nests." These nests are open to any member of the Vultures—including androids. The Vultures have found that a select few newer models of android seem largely unaffected by the virus spread throughout Entech. The androids, according to the Vultures, are often eager to prove themselves as forces of good, despite what they were built for. The Vultures have developed a screening process specifically for these rare android types that involves a complicated interview process as well as a test period to ensure that android wasn’t attempting to destroy a Vulture nest from the inside. NAIL frowns on how the Vultures conduct themselves, surviving in the chaos by embracing it rather than restoring order. Fights between the two factions are common. 

## Use of Technology 

Most survivors have strayed from using any technology in their lives out of fear it was controlled and/or monitored by Entech. NAIL is especially restrictive when it comes to technology, allowing only basic mechanical technology to be used by members. This includes older gun models, vintage cars (although these are hard to come by, and most people travel on foot regardless), walkie-talkies (used sparingly out of fear of the channel being intercepted. Most Nail members communicate via flare or smoke signal), among other things. As one might assume, the Vultures are less strict in their own use of technology. Many Vultures reclaim destroyed technology, especially Entech technology, and engineer their own weapons, body augments (prosthetics and implants), and vehicles. It is shoddy work at best but offers some advantages over avoiding technology altogether. 

 

 

# What is the future of this world? 

## Eradication 

A small NAIL task force was formed to recover any valuable information from Entech HQ that might lead to a possible solution to the android virus—ultimately, the only solution they see fit is the complete eradication of every android. Zero’s relation to their father gives them some idea of where to start, but a lot of investigation is still required in searching for a way to do this. Countless recon missions have been conducted around the site, but so far infiltration seems risky at best and flat-out suicidal at worst. NAIL is still constructing different attack plans for entering the core of the facility, where they expect to find the most information. The Vultures, rather, find this extermination inhumane. Instead, they are looking to cure the androids of this virus. They are looking for a way to coexist rather than wiping out all androids.

## Zero’s Potential 

I want to preface this section by reminding everyone of my desire for the final product of this world: I’m hoping to make a game out of this, and since Zero would be the “playable character,” I imagine a lot of things can/will happen to them. Because these are all working ideas, this section will be a bit more informal (compared to what I have written previously in this document). 

_Reincarnation_: This route is specifically an idea I had for a rogue-like format (for those that don’t know, it basically means gameplay is centered on the player repeatedly dying and restarting—typically becoming more powerful after each death, whether that be through in-game mechanics or new knowledge of the game itself). Zero, upon their first death, mysteriously has their consciousness placed into the body of an android. Obviously, this has a lot of negative effects, especially considering the faction they come from. NAIL no longer recognizes Zero as a human and thoroughly believes that they died in the field in search for valuable intel. Zero knows that any communication with NAIL would result in their immediate demise, so they are forced to abandon NAIL and pursue this mission by themself. As to why they can do this, I imagine it’s due to their relation to their father and Entech. My running idea is that Silas created an experimental chip that he implanted into Zero which allows them to preserve their consciousness. As a result, destruction of this chip results in the death of Zero’s consciousness, and thus killing Zero completely. 

_Outside Connections_: Either through their time spent outside of NAIL in the field, or due to conflicts between Zero’s and NAIL’s beliefs, Zero establishes secret connections with members of the Vulture faction, as well as other random survivors. This enables Zero to undergo cybernetic enhancements (either shoddy Vulture tech, or actual Entech implants/prosthetics) if they decide that that is the only possible way of making it through Entech HQ and finding a cure. In this route, the threat of Zero suffering from Co-Pilot syndrome is exponentially increased, and they run the risk of completely losing themself in pursuit of their goals. 

_Death to the Androids_: Zero resides completely within NAIL’s operation and does not stray from their processes or belief system. As Monty’s right-hand-man, Zero utilizes the resources around them to formulate a way to completely wipe out every living android. They do not receive any enhancements, strictly relying on the more archaic weapons/technology at their disposal to accomplish their mission. In this route, Zero can rid the world of the Entech virus, at the cost of eliminating every sentient AI/android.

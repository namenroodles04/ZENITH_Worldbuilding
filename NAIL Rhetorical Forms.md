## NAIL: RADIO TRANSMISSION RECORD ##

*The following was recorded the date of July 9th, 2306, between NAIL Captain Monty Brown and the leader of strike team A, Holden Vasquez. Two NAIL strike teams, consisting of five members each, were sent to gather intel on Entech HQ’s construction. The events that transpired were unanticipated, and thus have been noted for further investigation.*

*Level 4 Clearance is required for reviewing the following transcription. Any unauthorized viewership will be reported directly to Captain Monty Brown.* 

 
**[Recording Start, 2346 Hours]**

M: “Holden, you copy? Just what the hell is going on?!” 

H: “We infiltrated the building; I was trying to recon with strike team B, but we--” 

M: “Holden? Holden, what is happening?” 

H: “Shit, hold on, they--”


**[Holden became unresponsive for the next two minutes]**


H: “Jesus, sorry, they’re everywhere, Monty—the androids, I... I’ve never seen anything like it.” 

M: “Do not engage, just get the floor plan and get out!” 

H: “Monty... Rose is dead. So is Marco. The rest of us are trapped in a conference room on the first floor, and I’ve got no idea where the other team is. As far as I know, they’re dead, too.” 

M: “...There’s got to be a way.” 

H: “You don’t get it! They took Damon’s fucking leg! He’s delirious, Petra’s trying to do what she can, but we aren’t going anywhere. God, he almost got us all killed—started mumbling to himself about some salvation and then walked into... I’ll be damned if I knew. Some mass. We barely pulled him out before they ripped him apart. Whatever it was took Rose instead.” 

M: “And the other team? Nothing from them?” 

H: “...No, Monty, I haven’t. And you wanna know the damndest thing?” 

M: “...What is it, Holden?” 

H: “Rose. I can hear her still. On the other side of the door. We all can. She’s been begging for us to let her in.” 

M: “Holden, you said it yourself, Rose is dead. Whatever is on the other side of the door is not her.” 

H: “No, no but... but it is her. I know that voice anywhere, I would know if... if it weren’t...” 


**[Sounds of a mechanical door can be heard being unlocked. A voice screams Holden’s name in the background]**


H: “You’re just as beautiful as I remember...” 

M: “Holden? Holden, what did you do?! Dammit!” 

**[End Recording]**

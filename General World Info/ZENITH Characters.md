## ZERO MOORE ##
The protagonist. After the ZENITH outbreak, Zero lost all contact with their only remaining family member (their father). Since then, they have taken shelter with a local faction that is working towards storming the former HQ of Entech in search of a solution to the virus.

## SILAS MOORE ##
The protagonist's father. Former Senior Advisor of Entech Corporation. Declared missing the same day as the outbreak of the ZENITH virus. Presumed dead.

## KOR MCLANE ##
The protagonist's closest friend. They met each other in the same faction, but Kor is the only one who knows about Zero's father. She keeps quiet about the truth of Zero's past but urges Zero to use any of the info they might have to better plan their raid on Entech HQ. At the same time, she often questions the leadership choices of Monty.

## MONTY BROWN ##
Unspoken "leader" of the NAIL faction. Stereotypical big, gruff type. One of the only truly selfless people left on Earth, maybe to a fault. Puts the needs of the faction first, whatever those might be. This isn't to say he is unwilling to make sacrifices--whatever he believes serves the greater good is likely the action he will take.

## ELLIOT SEARS ##
A member of the Vulture faction, talon sector. He acts as an informant/collaborator/engineer to assist Zero and Kor as they infiltrate Entech HQ. Strongly opinionated on NAIL and how they operate, serves as a catalyst for Zero's view on androids. Prefers to go by his last name, not many people know his first name.

## ES8-10 ##
The being behind the sudden ZENITH outbreak. Certainly not human. Whatever it is, they want nothing to do with humanity and are aiming for a clean slate. Humanity was tempted by technology they could never understand and knowledge they could not dream to possess. ES8-10 is their reckoning.

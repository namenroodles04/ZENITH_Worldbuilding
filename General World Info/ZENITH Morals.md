Due to society's now fractured nature, the moral values vary from different factions to even the individual. There is generally one thing most people can agree on: you have to be selfish to survive now. The second you put someone else before yourself, you risk losing everything--including your life. There is certainly strength in numbers, but it is considered ideal to be the strongest of those numbers. Sometimes by any means necessary.
## View on Technology Use ##
Depending on who you ask, technology in this age is viewed either as a liberating force or a curse. For instance, a member of the Vultures may feel more indifferent towards technological upgrades or technology in general, while N.A.I.L has more of a zero-tolerance policy. Members of N.A.I.L work tirelessly to remove all forms of technology, after all.

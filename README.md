## HELLO! ##

**TRIGGER WARNING for some gruesome stuff in these files, mostly descriptions of gore.**

Hey everyone! I'm already a little bit familiar with GitHub, so apologies to those I'm throwing under the bus here. Luckily, it is pretty easy to navigate once you know what you're doing. Since this isn't anything crazy (like some huge coding project), everything you need should be under /main (AKA ZENITH_Worldbuilding). You should see a bunch of files listed in no particular order--that's where the ideas for this world I'm creating is. They should be labeled according to different aspects, such as geography, language, history, etc. If you ever get lost, just click the blue "ZENITH_Worldbuilding" link, which should take you back to the main page. But, if something looks wrong or you're having trouble accessing anything, feel free to email me at rbb176@lindenwood.edu. I'll try to fiddle with things as best I can to make it as easy as possible. Worst case scenario, I can also send you a PDF of everything pasted in there. Thanks, and enjoy!

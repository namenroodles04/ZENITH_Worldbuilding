## HELLO! ##

**TRIGGER WARNING for some gruesome stuff in these files, mostly descriptions of gore.**

Hey everyone! I'm already a little bit familiar with GitHub, so apologies to those I'm throwing under the bus here. Luckily, it is pretty easy to navigate once you know what you're doing. The file called "General World Info" is where I store most of my list & template things--they should be labeled according to different aspects, such as geography, language, history, etc. I'm in the process of adding some more detail to these, as well as adding my other submissions here too (I've already put the rhetorical forms). If something looks wrong or you're having trouble accessing anything, feel free to email me at rbb176@lindenwood.edu. I'll try to fiddle with things as best I can to make it as easy as possible. Worst case scenario, I can also send you a PDF of everything pasted in there. Thanks, and enjoy!
